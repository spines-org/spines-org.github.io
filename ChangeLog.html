<h4>Version 5.7 - March 5, 2025</h4>
<ul>
<li> Updates to support MacOS-Linux interoperability
<li> Fixed bug where incorrectly sized integer was used as skiplist key (uncovered in interoperability testing between ARM and x86)
<li> Updated outdated buildtools scripts (needed for ARM support)
<li> Updated documentation
</ul>

<h4>Version 5.6 - February 29, 2024</h4>
<ul>
<li> Changes to be compatible with latest versions of GCC</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 5.5 - December 23, 2020</h4>
<ul>

<li> The main change is this version is to use OpenSSL version 1.1.1

<li> Allows use of key size 512 bits in addition to previous version's 1024 bits and 2048 bits

</ul>

<h4>Version 5.4 - November 26, 2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>The main change is this version is to the dissemination-graph-based routing algorithm
    <ul>
        <li>Support for dissemination-graph-based routing in Spines 5.3 used
          static pre-computed graphs in all cases, but switched between these
          graphs based on changing network conditions. The 5.4 release makes
          this approach more dynamic, using two dynamically computed (not
          static) node-disjoint paths in the normal case, and including dynamic
          node-disjoint paths as one component of the resilient graphs used
          under the most problematic conditions.

        <li> This approach is described in Amy Babay's 2018 PhD thesis, "Timely,
          Reliable, and Cost-Effective Internet Transport Service using
          Structured Overlay Networks"
    </ul>

<li> Fixed bug in the interaction between link encryption and rate limiting
      added in Spines 5.3 that could cause crashes
    <ul>
        <li> Reported by Tiger Gao, Daniel Qian, Elaine Wong, and Jason Wong
    </ul>

<li> Fixed bug in realtime link protocol's calculation of how many nacks can
      fit in a packet

<li> Additional minor bugfixes, improved enforcement of message size
      constraints

<li> Performance tuning, increasing maximum message sizes and default
      bandwidth allowance (when rate limiting is used)

</ul>

<h4>Version 5.3 - March 9, 2018</h4>
<ul>
<li> Added Source-Based Routing capability (separate from K-paths used in
     Intrusion-Tolerant Messaging)
     <ul>
         <li> Supports using K node-disjoint paths, flooding, or dissemination graphs (see below)
     </ul>
<li> Added support for dissemination-graph-based routing (a specific type of source-based routing)
     <ul>
         <li> Based on the protocol from: "Timely, Reliable, and Cost-Effective
              Internet Transport Service using Dissemination Graphs," Amy Babay,
              Emily Wagner, Michael Dinitz, and Yair Amir, in Proceedings of the
              IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems,
              Atlanta, GA, June 2017, pp. 1-12.
     </ul>
<li> Turned off TCP fairness by default (can be enabled by starting Spines with
      the -tf commandline flag)
     <ul>
         <li> By default, we now turn off TCP fairness but impose a 500 Mbps rate
              limit on each link. The rate limit can be changed or turned off using
              the commandline -rl option
     </ul>
<li> Added an option for tracking and periodically printing the number of
      messages sent for each destination client at each daemon 
<li> Simplified loss rate calculation
<li> Changed report format of spines2port and port2spines test programs
<li> Fixed memory leak in intrusion-tolerant protocols stemming from not
      cleaning up OpenSSL context structures correctly
<li> Fixed libpread-util memory system to support allocating types smaller than
      sizeof(void*)
<li> Bug fixes in the reliable session
<li> Some tuning of default timeouts and window sizes to support higher
      throughput and more aggressive rerouting
</ul>

<h4>Version 5.2 - May 17, 2017</h4>
<ul>
<li>    Added configuration option to encrypt messages sent on intrusion-tolerant data link
<li>    Added configuration option to enable or disable remote client connections to daemons
<li>    Hardened code (security-wise) that is responsible for receiving messages from other daemons
<li>    Added site multicast for Intrusion-Tolerant Messaging (Priority and Reliable Messaging):
        <ul>
        <li> Messages sent with a specific destination port, when received at the destination daemon, are delivered to all clients of that daemon that have joined the multicast group
        </ul>
<li>    Added session option to specify behavior when the buffer between a daemon and its client fills:
        <ul>
        <li> Default option maintains connection but drops new packets that do not fit 
        <li> Other option closes the client connection when the buffer overflows
        </ul>
<li>    Initial separation of K-paths from Intrusion-Tolerant Messaging - *EXPERIMENTAL*
<li>    Added high resolution timestamps to Alarm logging
<li>    Some minor bug fixes, including:
        <ul>
        <li> Specific erroneous client connections are now cleaned up and do not cause daemon to exit
        <li> Multi-path routing now correctly delivers messages to local clients in a multicast group even if the destination daemon cannot be reached
        </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Version 5.1 - May 17, 2016</h4>
<ul>
<li>	Added support for Inter-Process Communication (UNIX Domain Sockets)
        <ul>
	<li> Daemon binds to default filepath, non-default path can be specified on cmd line or in config file
        <li> Changes to libspines to support AF_UNIX connections (on UNIX architectures)
        <li> Testprogs and Controlprogs updated - IPC is new default, can connect via non-default path or AF_INET

		<li> Controlprogs: setlink
		</ul>
	</ul>
<li>	New design (and improvements) for session blocking in Reliable Messaging
<li>	Added DL_send_connected() to send scatter gather using send_msg function for connection-based AF_INET and AF_UNIX sockets
<li>    Added new session semantics (chosen by application) needed for IT reliable communication:
        <ul>
	<li> RELIABLE_STREAM: Block session when flow buffers become full toward any destination
        <li> RELIABLE_DGRAM_NO_BACKPRESSURE: Silently drop messages that do not fit, no blocking 
		<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp *Experimental* (May be subject to change)
        <li> RELIABLE_DGRAM_WITH_BACKPRESSURE: Explicit feedback indicating which messages are accepted, no blocking
		<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp *Experimental* (Not in open source yet)
	</ul>
<li>	Renamed both of the intrusion-tolerant messaging semantics to more accurately match behavior:
	<ul>
	<li> Changed BEST_EFFORT_FLOOD_ROUTING to IT_PRIORITY_ROUTING
